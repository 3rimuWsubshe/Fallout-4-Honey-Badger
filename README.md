### Installing a mod
     
The easiest and most recommended way to get the Honey Badger in Fallout 4 is by installing a mod that adds it to the game. There are several mods that do this, but we will focus on two of them: Honey badger by Warfighters Workshop and AAC Honey Badger by Warfighters Workshop and F34R WAK. Both mods are available on Nexus Mods, a popular website for downloading and managing mods for various games.
     
Honey badger by Warfighters Workshop adds three versions of the Honey Badger to Fallout 4: one from Modern Warfare Remastered and two from Ghosts. Each version has its own stats, sounds, animations, and customization options. You can craft the Honey Badger at any chemistry station under the utility category, or find it in various locations throughout the Commonwealth. You can also enable leveled list integration, which means that the Honey Badger will spawn on enemies and vendors according to your level.
     
AAC Honey Badger by Warfighters Workshop and F34R WAK adds one version of the Honey Badger to Fallout 4, based on the real-life AAC Honey Badger PDW. This version has custom sounds, animations, and a wide range of attachments, such as sights, grips, magazines, muzzles, and more. You can craft the AAC Honey Badger at any weapons workbench under the PDW category, or find it in a hidden location near Vault 111. You can also enable leveled list integration for this mod as well.
     
To install either of these mods, you will need to download them from Nexus Mods and use a mod manager, such as Nexus Mod Manager (NMM), Vortex, or Mod Organizer 2 (MO2), to install them into your Fallout 4 game folder. You will also need to have some other mods installed as requirements, such as Armor and Weapon Keywords Community Resource (AWKCR), Caliber Complex (CC), Tactical Reload Framework (TRF), and others. You can find the full list of requirements on each mod's page on Nexus Mods.
     
### Using console commands
     
If you don't want to install any mods, you can still get the Honey Badger in Fallout 4 by using console commands. Console commands are commands that you can type into a special window that opens when you press the tilde (~) key on your keyboard while playing Fallout 4. Console commands allow you to manipulate various aspects of the game, such as spawning items, changing settings, toggling features, and more.
     
To get the Honey Badger in Fallout 4 by using console commands, you will need to know its base ID, which is a unique code that identifies each item in the game. You can find the base ID of any item by using the help command in the console. For example, if you type help "Honey Badger" 4 weap , you will see a list of all weapons that have "Honey Badger" in their name and their base IDs. Alternatively, you can use a website like [Fallout 4 Item Codes] to look up the base IDs of any item in Fallout 4.
     
Once you know the base ID of the Honey Badger you want, you can use the player.additem command to add it to your inventory. For example, if you want to add the Modern Warfare Remastered version of the Honey Badger from Warfighters Workshop's mod, you can type player.additem xx000800 , where xx is the load order number of the mod in your game. You can find the load order number of any mod by using a mod manager or by looking at the plugins.txt file in your Fallout 4 appdata folder.

After you add the Honey Badger to your inventory, you can equip it and use it as any other weapon in Fallout 4. However, keep in mind that using console commands can have some drawbacks, such as breaking quests, causing glitches, or disabling achievements. Therefore, use them at your own risk and always make a backup save before using them.
     
## Why use the Honey Badger in Fallout 4
     
The Honey Badger is a versatile and powerful weapon that can suit different playstyles and situations in Fallout 4. Here are some of the reasons why you might want to use it:
     
- It has an integrated silencer, which means that it does not reduce your damage output or range like other silencers do. It also makes you harder to detect by enemies when you fire it, which is useful for stealthy or sneaky characters.
- It has a high rate of fire, which means that it can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time. It also has a decent accuracy and recoil, which makes it easy to control and aim. It is especially effective against enemies that have low armor or health, such as raiders, ghouls, or mutants.
- It has a lot of customization options, which means that you can modify it to suit your preferences and needs. You can change its sights, grips, magazines, muzzles, and more to improve its performance and appearance. You can also apply different camouflages and paints to make it look more unique and stylish.
- It is based on a real-life weapon, which means that it has a realistic and authentic design and feel. It also has custom sounds and animations that match its original counterparts from Call of Duty: Ghosts and Modern Warfare Remastered. If you are a fan of these games or of modern military weapons in general, you will enjoy using the Honey Badger in Fallout 4.

## Conclusion
     
The Honey Badger is a great weapon to have in Fallout 4, whether you are looking for a stealthy, fast-firing, or customizable PDW. You can get it by installing one of the mods that add it to the game, or by using console commands if you prefer. Either way, you will have a lot of fun using the iconic weapon of the Ghosts in the wasteland.
